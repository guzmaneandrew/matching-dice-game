Dice App
- Click Roll! buttons to "roll dice"

FRONT-END
- Textbox: for user name
- Button: to roll dice1
- Button: to roll dice2
- Button: to send name, dice1, and dice2 values to the backend

App Functionality Notes
- DONE Temporarily used hardcoded values for dice1 and dice2. 
- DONE Values to be created(but not revealed) when the roll buttons are clicked. 
- DONE The values are to be revealed(and sent with a name in a POST request to the backend)when the Click to Reveal! button is clicked.

Progress Notes
- 4/19 Working on get method to get values of rolled dice
- 4/20 Worked on post handler functions to get dice values from the backend.
- 4/21 Fixed get request to get dice values from backend and implemented disabled/enabled functionality to the Click to Reveal button

!!Bugs to fix
- Disable the Roll buttons once they have been clicked
- Fixed: Unable to reveal values without entering name.
- Fixed: Unable to reveal dice values until both dice have been rolled
- Fixed: Why is ${user} undefined?? User was undefined because I didn't send data to the backend in the post request.
- Add a refresh button to reload a new dice game
- If dice are not rolled, still able to submit and alwasy matching dice

Questions?? 
- When do you use post vs get http method? Post = get & put, get is only if you are receiving data from the backend, put is if you are sending data to the backend, and post does both.
